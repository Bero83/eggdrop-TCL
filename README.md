# TCL
TCL for eggdrop bots (1.6.x branch)

A collection of eggdrop scripts, made by istok on/for the IRCSpeed IRC Network (irc.ircspeed.org)

Please read the Licence that comes with this repo.

They are intended to do what each script does. If you wish for a feature/change, please either attempt this 
yourself (as the code is basic, even for a beginner), or join the IRCSpeed #eggdrop channel and wait patiently for istok, or someone to become active. 

This does NOT mean istok will make/fix your request, but dialogue with the Author is always recommended.
